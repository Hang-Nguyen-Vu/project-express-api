# Project Express API

A project creating the API with Express.

## The problem

I chose to work with the Lego data from Kaggle, which is a massive dataset. I created the required endpoints for documention, returing an array and returning a singel item and added a few other dummy endpoints for future use. I found it interesting to see that the order in which you create the routes may matter, especially when you use the same path in those routes. I will continue to read more about API design. I built a simple front-end just to see if the endpoints work and to practise some of the parts that I learnt from previous projects. With this data set, if I had more time, I would try to find out a way to slice the data so that it could be displayed in pages in the front-end. Right now, it is a very long list of lego sets in the homepage.
